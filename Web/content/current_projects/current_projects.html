			<h2 class='no-top-pad'>The EAGLE Project</h2>
			<p>EAGLE (Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments) is a simulation aimed at understanding how galaxies form and evolve.  This computer calculation models the formation of structures in a cosmological volume, 100 Mega<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec">parsec</a>s on a side (over 300 million light-years). This is large enough to contain 10,000 galaxies of the size of the Milky Way or bigger, enabling a comparison with the whole zoo of galaxies visible in the <a href="http://hubblesite.org/hubble_discoveries/hubble_deep_field/">Hubble Deep field</a> for example.</p>

			<p>You can find out more about EAGLE on their website, which is hosted at <a href="http://icc.dur.ac.uk/Eagle">http://icc.dur.ac.uk/Eagle</a>.</p>
