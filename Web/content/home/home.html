		<h1>What is the Virgo Consortium?</h1>
			<p>
The Virgo Consortium 
for Cosmological Supercomputer Simulations was founded in 1994 in response 
to the UK's High Performance Computing Initiative. Virgo developed rapidly 
into the international collaboration that it is today. The Virgo Consortium 
has a core membership of about a dozen scientists in the UK, Germany, Netherlands, Canada 
the USA and Japan. The largest nodes are the <a href="http://www.icc.dur.ac.uk" target="_blank">
Institute for Computational Cosmology</a> in Durham, UK and the <a href="http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de">Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics</a> in Garching, Germany.
The Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS) has recently joined as a node. Other nodes exist in Cambridge, Edinburgh, Nottingham and Sussex in the UK, Leiden in the Netherlands, McMaster and Queen's Universities in Canada, Pittsburgh University in the USA and Nagoya University in Japan. At any given time, an additional 20-25 scientists, mostly PhD students and postdocs, are directly involved in aspects of the Virgo 
programme.</p>

		<h2>Science Goals</h2>
		<p>The science goals 
of Virgo are to carry out state-of-the-art cosmological simulations. The research areas  include the large-scale distribution of dark matter, the
formation of dark matter haloes, the formation and evolution of galaxies and clusters, 
the physics of the intergalactic medium and the properties of the intracluster gas. </p>

		<h1>Resources</h1>
		<p>Virgo has access to world class supercomputing resources in the UK and Germany, including the dedicated <a href='http://icc.dur.ac.uk/index.php?content=Computing/Cosma'>"Comology Machine"</a> at Durham. The Cosmology Machine (COSMA) has been in existence for almost 12 years and is now in its 5th generation. COSMA currently has 6720 Intel Sandy Brige cores, and 53,760 GB of RAM.</p>
